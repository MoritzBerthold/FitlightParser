# FitlightParser
## Prerequisites
* python3 needs to be installed.
* use *pip install tkinter* if tkinter module is not installed

## Usage
1. Navigate to this folder in our cmd/shell/bash
2. Call *python3 parse.py*
3. Choose the files you want to parse
4. Choose the directory the output should be saved to (files with same name as output files will be overwritten!!!)
5. Enjoy!

Note: File names will be like *"<input_file_name>_out.csv"*

Once *run.sh* is tested, it can also be used to start the application.
